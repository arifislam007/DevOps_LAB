**Essential Linux Commands**

This section provides a reference guide for some of the most frequently used Linux commands for basic file and directory management, navigation, and system information retrieval.

**File and Directory Management:**

* **`ls`:** Lists the contents of the current directory. Use flags like `-l` for detailed information, `-a` to show hidden files, or `-h` for human-readable file sizes.

* **`pwd`:** Prints the full path of the current working directory.

* **`cd`:** Changes the current working directory. Navigate to the home directory with `cd ~`, move up one level with `cd ..`, or enter a specific directory path.

* **`mkdir`:** Creates a new directory. Specify a name after `mkdir`.

* **`rmdir`:** Removes an empty directory. Use with caution, as deleted directories cannot be recovered.

* **`rm`:** Removes files (use with caution!). Consider `rm -rf` (forcefully removes recursively) only when absolutely necessary and after backups.

* **`cp`:** Copies files or directories. Specify the source and destination after `cp`.

* **`mv`:** Moves or renames files or directories. Provide the source and destination after `mv`.

* **`touch`:** Creates an empty file. Useful for creating placeholders or markers.

**Navigation:**

* **`cd ~`:** Navigates to the home directory.

* **`cd -`:** Returns to the previous directory.

* **`cd ..`:** Moves to the parent directory.

**System Information:**

* **`uname -a`:** Displays kernel information, including the operating system name, version, and architecture.

* **`df`:** Shows disk usage information for mounted filesystems.

* **`free`:** Displays available and used memory (RAM).

* **`ps aux`:** Lists all running processes with detailed information (user, PID, CPU usage, etc.).

* **`top`:** Provides a dynamic view of running processes, sorting by CPU usage by default. Useful for monitoring system performance.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use the `man` command (e.g., `man ls`) to access detailed manual pages for specific commands.

* Experiment with these commands in a safe environment (like a dedicated test directory) to practice and learn.
