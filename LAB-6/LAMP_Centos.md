To set up a PHP repository on CentOS 7 and install PHP along with its dependencies, follow these steps, incorporating guidance from the provided sources:

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, you need to install the `yum-utils` package and enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository, which provides additional packages beyond what is available in the default CentOS repositories.

```bash
sudo yum install yum-utils -y
sudo yum install epel-release -y
```

### Step 2: Add Remi's Repository

Remi's repository offers newer versions of PHP compared to the default CentOS repositories. To add Remi's repository, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
```

### Step 3: Enable PHP Repository

Choose the PHP version you want to install. For example, to enable PHP 7.2, use the following command:

```bash
sudo yum-config-manager --enable remi-php72
```

If you prefer another version, replace `remi-php72` with `remi-php71` for PHP 7.1 or `remi-php73` for PHP 7.3.

### Step 4: Install PHP and Common Extensions

Now, install PHP along with some common extensions. Adjust the command based on the PHP version you chose in the previous step.

```bash
sudo yum install php php-common php-opcache php-mcrypt php-cli php-gd php-curl php-mysql -y
```

### Step 5: Verify PHP Installation

Check the installed PHP version to ensure the installation was successful:

```bash
php -v
```

### Optional: Install Additional PHP Modules

You can search for and install additional PHP modules as needed. To search for available PHP modules, use:

```bash
sudo yum search php | more
```

To install a specific module, use:

```bash
sudo yum install php-module_name -y
```

Replace `module_name` with the name of the module you wish to install.

By following these steps, you will have successfully added a PHP repository to your CentOS 7 system and installed PHP along with its dependencies. This setup allows you to leverage newer PHP versions and extend PHP capabilities with additional modules as required.
