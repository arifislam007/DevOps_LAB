# Kubernetes Labels, Selectors, and matchLabels

This repository provides examples and explanations for working with **labels**, **selectors**, and **matchLabels** in Kubernetes. These are fundamental concepts for organizing, selecting, and managing Kubernetes objects like Pods, Services, and Deployments.

## Overview

In Kubernetes, **labels** are key-value pairs used to identify and organize objects, such as Pods. **Selectors** and **matchLabels** help Kubernetes components, like Services and Deployments, find and manage these objects based on their labels. This makes it easier to categorize and target specific Pods for different operations.

- **Labels**: Metadata attached to Kubernetes objects for identification.
- **Selectors**: Used to filter and target objects based on their labels.
- **matchLabels**: A more specific form of selector used in Deployments and ReplicaSets.

## Labels

Labels are attached to Kubernetes objects to help organize and categorize them. They are key-value pairs that describe attributes of the object.

### Example of a Pod with Labels:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
    environment: production
    version: v1
```

In this example:
- **app**: The application is identified as `nginx`.
- **environment**: The environment is labeled as `production`.
- **version**: The version of the application is `v1`.

## Selectors

Selectors are used by Kubernetes controllers (like Services or Deployments) to target objects based on their labels. A **selector** defines how Kubernetes filters objects to apply specific actions.

### Example of a Service with a Selector:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

In this example:
- The **Service** will select all Pods with the label `app: nginx` and expose them on port 80.
- The selector ensures that the traffic reaches the right Pods.

## matchLabels

**matchLabels** is part of a **selector** used by Deployments, ReplicaSets, and other controllers. It requires an **exact match** between the specified key-value pairs and the labels on target Pods.

### Example of a Deployment using matchLabels:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In this example:
- The **Deployment** manages 3 Pods running the `nginx` application.
- The **matchLabels** section ensures that only Pods with the label `app: nginx` will be managed by this Deployment.

## Example: Using Labels, Selectors, and matchLabels

This example demonstrates how to use labels, selectors, and matchLabels to manage a group of NGINX Pods and expose them through a Service.

### Pod with Labels:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
    environment: production
```

### Service with a Selector:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

The Service will route traffic to all Pods labeled with `app: nginx`.

## How to Apply the Manifests

1. Save the Pod manifest as `nginx-pod.yaml`:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
   ```

2. Save the Service manifest as `nginx-service.yaml`:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
   ```
